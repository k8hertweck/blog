## Biography

Kate Hertweck is a scientist and educator
who endeavors to uphold core values like:
diversity/equity/inclusion, 
accessibility of information, and
learning over knowing.
Kateâ€™s graduate training at University of Missouri focused on genomic evolution of plants,
and was followed by a postdoctoral fellowship at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent, Duke University)
where they began working exclusively in computational biology.
Kate then spent four years as an assistant professor teaching 
bioinformatics, genomics, plant taxonomy,
and scientific communication.
Although Kate has since transitioned away from teaching formal university courses,
they now specialize in training and community building that supports researchers
(specifically, biomedical researchers) 
in adopting reproducible computational methods and other aspects of open science. 
Kate is an instructor and trainer for [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org)
(serving as a leader in community governance from 2016-2019),
and is an advisor for [Metadocencia](https://metadocencia.netlify.app).
These non-profit groups support best practices in teaching
for data/computational skills and Spanish-speaking educators, respectively.
Kate likes to spend their time enjoying all things science fiction
and knitting sweaters from handspun yarn for their tiny, grumpy, elderly rescue dog, Loki.
Kate uses perceived pronouns,
so any pronoun you think fits also works for them.
