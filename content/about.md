Kate Hertweck is the bioinformatics training manager at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 
where they lead development and implementation of courses on reproducible computational methods through [fredhutch.io](http://www.fredhutch.io) 
and facilitate collaborative communities of practice through [the Coop](http://thecoop.fredhutch.org). 
Kate's graduate training at University of Missouri in genomic evolution of plants was followed by a postdoctoral fellowship at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) at Duke University, 
where they began working exclusively in computational biology. 
Kate then spent four years as an assistant professor teaching bioinformatics, genomics, and plant taxonomy before transitioning to focus on biomedical research training. 
Kate is a Carpentries trainer and served as a leader in community governance from 2016-2019. 
When not being an overenthusiastic instructor, 
Kate likes to spend their time doing fiber arts (knitting, crochet) 
and enjoying all things science fiction.
