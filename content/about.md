## Biography

Kate Hertweck is a scientist and educator
who endeavors to uphold core values like:
diversity/equity/inclusion, 
accessibility of information, and
learning over knowing.
Kateâ€™s graduate training at University of Missouri focused on genomic evolution of plants,
and was followed by a postdoctoral fellowship at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent, Duke University)
where they began working exclusively in computational biology.
Kate then spent four years as an assistant professor teaching 
bioinformatics, genomics, plant taxonomy,
and scientific communication.
Kate then transitioned to supporting biomedical researchers in applying reproducible computational methods and other open science skills,
first as bioinformatics training manager at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center,
and currently at [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com).
Kate currently works as Program Manager for the Open Science program at CZI.
Kate has volunteered for a variety of open science training groups
(more information available on the [Projects](/projects/) page).
Kate likes to spend their time enjoying all things science fiction
and knitting sweaters from handspun yarn for their tiny (and sometimes angry) dog.
Kate uses perceived pronouns,
so any pronoun you think fits also works for them.
