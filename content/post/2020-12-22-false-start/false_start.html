<p>I wrote my first blog post in July,
then promptly neglected any subsequent posts until December.
Classic me!</p>
<p>Shortly after writing that first post,
I decided to switch up how the site was built.
My initial instinct had been to use a Jekyll site
with the <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes">Minimal Mistakes theme</a>,
an approach that was familiar to me from websites I support during
my day job at [Fred Hutch]({{&lt; ref “/projects” &gt;}}).</p>
<p>This website is built using the <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes">Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme</a>
and is deployed using a <a href="https://github.com/k8hertweck/blog">public GitHub repository and GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
