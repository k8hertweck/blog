I wrote my first blog post in July,
then promptly neglected any subsequent posts until December.

Shortly after writing that first post,
I decided to switch up how the site was built.
My initial instinct had been to use a Jekyll site
with the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)
and deploy with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com),
an approach that was familiar to me from websites I support during
my day job at [Fred Hutch]({{< ref "/projects#FredHutch" >}}).

That approach lasted all of five days,
after which I decided to take the plunge and
convert to a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) site generated from 
[`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)
and deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
It was my first time using any of these tools,
and at first, it literally turned my world on its head:

Why did it only happen in one web browser,
only on one of my MacBook Air laptops?
Who knows!
It's fixed now.

If you're interested in the code behind this site,
the [repository](https://github.com/k8hertweck/blog) is available publicly on GitHub.
