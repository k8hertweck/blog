<p>For someone who has bought into social media and reproducible research in so many other ways,
it’s difficult to pinpoint exactly why it took me this long to invest more fully in a website for myself.
Regardless, I’m pleased to finally be taking the leap and creating a place to store information about my professional life,
as well as details regarding my personal life that may intersect with my profession.</p>
<p>I’m glad to lean on the open source community at large for the infrastructure and tools to make this a user-friendly (me) and audience-friendly (you) experience.
I’m looking forward to continuing to update here,
and migrate content out of my (sadly wallowing, kind of embarrassing)
previous website and blog.</p>
