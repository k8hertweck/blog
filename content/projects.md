## CV-ish things

My [publications](/publications/) page includes information about my professional experience,
links for professional works (publications, presentations, etc) and associated metrics,
and specific deliverable products grouped by topic area.

## The Carpentries

[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) is a non-profit organization
that teaches data and computational skills to researchers.
I have been an instructor for the group since 2014,
and a trainer (who teaches people to be instructors)
since 2019.
I also served in leadership of community governance from 2015-2018.

## MetaDocencia

[MetaDocencia](https://metadocencia.netlify.app) is a non-profit organization
that helps Spanish-speaking teachers improve their instructional methods.
I'm proud to serve as an advisor for their growing program.

## Merely Useful

I collaborate with a small group of diverse researchers on a book project,
called [Merely Useful](https://merely-useful.github.io) when it began in 2018.
The first book from this project,
[*Research Software Engineering with Python: Building software that makes research possible*](https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/index.html),
was published by Taylor and Francis in July 2021.
We have begun work on the second book,
about research software engineering in R.
All of our work for this project is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/merely-useful/),
both during and after development.

## Workshops

I teach workshops related to both technical and non-technical (e.g., professional development) skills.
All workshop materials listed below are open source and useful in self-directed learning.

### Technical workshops

My teaching methods for technical skills related to data and computing skills are heavily influenced by The Carpentries,
which are designed to help researchers and research support staff gain technical skills.
More information about Carpentries workshops,
including lesson materials and curricula,
is available [here](https://carpentries.org/workshops/).

While at Fred Hutch,
I adapted and developed workshop materials to teach data and computing skills to biomedical researchers.
These training materials are available through [fredhutch.io](http://www.fredhutch.io).

### Professional assets in data science careers

Workshop materials are available [in this GitHub repository](https://github.com/k8hertweck/professional_assets_data_science).

This workshop has been presented at:

* [Women in Data Science (WiDS) Puget Sound conference](https://www.widspugetsound.org), May 2020, material available as [powerpoint](slides/professional-assets-data-scienceWIDS2020.pdf) and [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Atp76i_4-Qa755moKgdZDTuhtDhbBNokEqnnuNgObPw/edit?usp=sharing), video available [here](https://datacircles.org/blog-1/conference-video-kate-hertweck-phd-workshop-more-than-code-professional-assets-in-data-science-careers)
* [CarpentryCon @ Home](https://2020.carpentrycon.org), August 2020, materials available as [powerpoint](slides/professional-assets-data-scienceCCHome2020.pdf) and [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Iso5pdK_PaMRnPzWhlFoPAz5dI6JWQxrGHPMYyTzsTU/edit?usp=sharing)
