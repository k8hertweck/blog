## Fred Hutch

I work for [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](https://fredhutch.org)
as Bioinformatics Training Manager.
This means I develop and implement a training program for computational research methods
for our research community.
Most of my effort is dedicated to developing curriculum in the form of
short courses through [fredhutch.io](http://www.fredhutch.io),
and building community to share knowledge via the
Fred Hutch Bioinformatics and Data Science Cooperative,
or [The Coop](http://thecoop.fredhutch.org).
