## CV-ish things

My [publications](/publications/) page includes information about my professional experience,
links for professional works (publications, presentations, etc) and associated metrics,
and professional works grouped by area of research.

## Fred Hutch

I work for [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](https://fredhutch.org)
as Bioinformatics Training Manager,
developing and implementing a training program for computational research methods
for our research community.
Most of my effort is dedicated to developing curriculum in the form of
short courses through [fredhutch.io](http://www.fredhutch.io),
and building community to share knowledge via the
Fred Hutch Bioinformatics and Data Science Cooperative,
or [The Coop](http://thecoop.fredhutch.org).

## The Carpentries

[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) is a non-profit organization
that teaches data and computational skills to researchers.
I have been an instructor for the group since 2014,
and a trainer (who teaches people to be instructors)
since 2019.
I also served in leadership of community governance from 2015-2018.

## MetaDocencia

[MetaDocencia](https://metadocencia.netlify.app) is a non-profit organization
that helps Spanish-speaking teachers improve their instructional methods.
I'm proud to serve as an advisor for their growing program.

## Merely Useful

I collaborate with a small group of diverse researchers on a book project,
called [Merely Useful](https://merely-useful.github.io) when it began in 2018.
The first book from this project,
[*Research Software Engineering with Python: Building software that makes research possible*](https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/index.html),
will be published by Taylor and Francis by spring 2021.
We have begun work on the second book,
about research software engineering in R.
All of our work for this project is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/merely-useful/),
both during and after development.

## Workshops

In addition to the technical workshops I teach through Fred Hutch and the Carpentries,
I also develop and teach workshops for conferences. 

### Professional assets in data science careers

Workshop materials are available [in this GitHub repository](https://github.com/k8hertweck/professional_assets_data_science).

This workshop has been presented at:

* [Women in Data Science (WiDS) Puget Sound conference](https://www.widspugetsound.org), May 2020, material available as [powerpoint](slides/professional-assets-data-scienceWIDS2020.pdf) and [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Atp76i_4-Qa755moKgdZDTuhtDhbBNokEqnnuNgObPw/edit?usp=sharing), video available [here](https://datacircles.org/blog-1/conference-video-kate-hertweck-phd-workshop-more-than-code-professional-assets-in-data-science-careers)
